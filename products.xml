    <name>Collagen</name>
    <description>Collagen is a vital protein found abundantly throughout the body, serving as a structural component in various tissues such as skin, bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. It provides strength, elasticity, and support to these tissues, contributing to their overall integrity and function. As we age, collagen production naturally decreases, leading to wrinkles, joint stiffness, and other signs of aging. Consequently, collagen supplements have gained popularity for their potential to support skin health, joint mobility, and overall well-being.</description>
